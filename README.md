This repository is contribution-friendly :smiley:. If you're an algorithms enthusiast and want to add or improve an algorithm your contribution is welcome!

#### Adding a new algorithm

The procedure to add a new algorithm or snippet of code is:

1. If there doesn't already exist an issue, then file a new issue explaining the algorithm/change you want to do.
2. Make sure the algorithm doesn't already exist! We don't want duplicate algorithms ðŸ˜¬
